Since then, the PQHP has developed more academic and popular publications, events, as well as select archival collections online.

                            <span class="highlight">Dr. Harrison Apple</span> is an oral historian and archivist who began the Pittsburgh Queer History Project after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University. They received their PhD in Gender & Women’s Studies from the University of Arizona. Their work examines local histories of voluntary associations and ‘drinking clubs’ as the context for the Pittsburgh Queer History Project’s archives. Their work asks why these materials come together as a community archives, beyond their relationship to sexual identity,  working with the overlapping meanings of “membership” that circulate in the PQHP’s records. They are currently working at Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Fine Arts at the Associate Director of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry.

                            Their research interests include archival studies, oral history, biopolitics, transgender studies, and critical race studies. Their writing has been published in Archivaria, Transgender Studies Quarterly, Outhistory.org and the Introduction to Transgender Studies textbook from Harrington Park Press, edited by Ardel Haefle-Thomas.

                            Broadly, his research interests examine changing roles of masculinity and the role of the state in formulating male identities in the nineteenth and twentieth century. This research has produced work that examines new cultural roles for men, as well as examining policy issues concerning sexuality and military service.
                            Besides his historical work, his satirical commentary appears in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette frequently. In support of his dissertation research, he was awarded a Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship, and, with Jared Day, has received support from the New-York Historical Society and the Bibliography Society of America to support current work on the satirical newspapers of antebellum New York.                        </p>
